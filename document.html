<h4>What are workflows?</h4>

<p>"Workflows describe the relationship of the individual computational components and their input and output data in a
    declarative way."[1] Workflow has an explicit structure and representations. Nodes of a workflow can be said to represent a
    process and edges the data flow between the processes. "A program (or script) is to a workflow what an unstructured document
    is to a (structured) database."[1] Each step in a workflow specifies the computation to be executed. The steps of a workflow
    are linked according to the data flow and their dependencies. [2]</p>

<h3>Business workflows vs. scientific workflows</h3>

<p>Example use cases of scientific workflow: [1]</p>
<ul>
    <li>In astronomy, scientists are using workflows to generate science-grade mosaics of the sky, to examine the structure
        of galaxies, and, in general, to understand the structure of the universe.</li>
    <li>In bioinformatics, researchers are using workflows to understand the underpinnings of complex diseases.</li>
    <li>In physics, workflows are used to search for gravitational waves and model the structure of atoms.</li>
    <li>In ecology, scientists use workflows to explore the issues of biodiversity.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
    One of the major differences between business and scientific workflows are that, business workflows are control
    flow oriented while scientific processes are data flow oriented. This fact can be explained as follows: a dependency
    in scientific flow "characterizes the data relationship between an input and output of two respective tasks of a scientific
    workflow whereas a dependency characterizes the partial order relation between the executions of two tasks in a business
    workflow."[1]The data flow does not impose an order of execution, it only specifies the input and output of components;
    component B should use component A’s output as input. In scientific workflows a number of tasks can be concurrent but
    not in business workflows. Tasks represented in parallel will mean a conditional choice of one of them.
</p>

<p>Business workflows follow a clear set of rules but scientific workflows involve several different complex computing
    processes and complex data. "To design a robust, fault-tolerance, and adaptive workflow, scientific workflow requires
    modeling of complex control-flow in an essential data-flow oriented environment".[1] Another difference is that scientists
    are concerned about the intermediate steps, results and data of a scientific process while business people are only
    interested in optimizing possible parts of their process to reduce maintenance cost. Therefore "provenance management"
    is identified to be of significant importance in scientific workflow management systems. [1] Scientific workflows
    usually have simple computational models but business workflows have expressive languages (BPEL) to specify complex
    control flow. Scientific workflows are usually based on data intensive tasks. [3] A point related to the above is;
    "Scientific research requires flexible design and exploration capabilities that appear to depart significantly from
    the more prescriptive use of workflows in business" [3]. "Another distinctive issue of scientific workflows is the
    variety and heterogeneity of data within a single workflow."[3]</p>

<h3>Scientific workflows</h3>

<p>Three motivations for scientific workflow have been identified as follows: [4]</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some complex e-science applications often require the creation of a collaborative workflow</li>
    <li>Many e-scientists lack the necessary low-level expertise to utilize the current generation of
        underlying computing infrastructure such as Grid toolkits</li>
    <li>Workflow specifications can be reused, modified and shared once they are defined.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following are some of the basic structures or components of scientific workflows.
    The final workflow is usually composed of several such components. [5]
    <br>
    <b>Process structure:</b> Operates on some input data to provide an output
    <br>
    <b>Pipeline structure:</b> Several data processing jobs are combined sequentially
    <br>
    <b>Data distribution structure:</b> Can be categorized in two parts;
    produce output data that are consumed by multiple jobs and
    operate on large datasets and divide them into smaller subsets to be processed by other job in the workflow - also
    called as Data portioning structure Data partitioning leads to increased parallelism in the later stages on the workflow
    which is the purpose of it.
    <br>
    <b>Data aggregation structure:</b> Aggregate and process the output of several individual jobs and generate a combined output.
    This leads to a reduction of parallelism on the workflow. It is also time consuming.
    <br>
    <b>Data redistribution structure:</b> Data aggregated from a previous stage are redistributed to multiple jobs in a following stage.
    This represents a potential bottleneck but once again increases parallelism. This is used in many workflows and represents
    a synchronization point from the data flow perspective.

<h3>Workflow engines and scientific workflow management systems</h3>
<p>
    Both scientific and business workflow management systems provide means to, [1]</p>
<ol>
    <li>Model and specify processes with design primitives</li>
    <li>Re-engineer developed processes such as verification and optimization</li>
    <li>Automating the execution of processes by scheduling, controlling and monitoring the tasks</li>
</ol>
<p>
    "Workflow systems have a number of advantages for constructing and managing computational tasks compared to programs and scripts.
    They provide a simple programming model whereby a sequence of tasks is composed by connecting the outputs of one task to the
    inputs of another. Furthermore, workflow systems often provide intuitive visual programming interfaces, which make them more
    suitable for users who do not have substantial programming expertise". [3].  Even though the existing workflow management systems
    provide various capabilities researches are still going on to solve issues regarding creation, reuse, provenance tracking,
    performance optimization, and reliability. Not only that, advanced researches in science have forced for more capabilities like
    "supporting dynamic event-driven analyses, handling streaming data, accommodating interaction with users, intelligent assistance
    and collaborative support for workflow design, and enabling result sharing across collaborations" [2].</p>

<h3>Desirable application level features of scientific workflow management systems</h3>

<h5>Collaboration</h5>
<p>Scientific researches and experiments often involve a group of people spread among different physical locations.
    They need to collaborate in order to provide efficient and accurate results from the scientific processes. "Within
    these collaborations, various individuals are responsible for different aspects of data acquisition, processing,
    and analysis, and entire projects often generate publications." [2] Such environments require tools that can manage
    the steps of scientific discovery and bridge the differing expertise of individuals. "Today, complex scientific analyses
    increasingly require tremendous amounts of human effort and manual coordination." [2]</p>
<h5>Reproducibility</h5>
<p>"Reproducibility is at the core of the scientific method, enabling scientists to evaluate the validity of each other’s
    hypotheses and pro- viding the basis for establishing known truths. Reproducibility requires rich provenance information
    so researchers can repeat techniques and analysis methods to obtain scientifically similar results." [2] With the various
    tools and methods for storing and sharing information (e-mails, wiki entries etc.), it is easy to lose track of provenance
    data. Therefore it is important for workflow management systems to have a strong mechanism to capture and generate provenance
    information. Not only that, WFMS should pass along the provenance information of input data to the output.  "Workflow systems
    must complement existing data repositories with provenance and metadata repositories that enable the discovery of the workflows
    and application components used to create the data. Two important concerns for scientists in these highly collaborative endeavors
    are credit assignment and recognition of individual contributions." [2]</p>
<h5>Flexible environments</h5>
<p>"Individual scientists should be able to steer the system to conduct unique analyses and create novel workflows
    with previously unseen combinations and configurations of models". [2]. These flexible environments must ensure security,
    reliability and scalability as well.</p>

<h3>What is provenance?</h3>
<p>
    "The provenance (also referred to as the audit trail, lineage, and pedigree) of a data product contains information about
    the process and data used to derive the data product." [3] This data consists of answers to the following questions: [3]</p>
<ul>
    <li>Who created this data product and when</li>
    <li>When was it modified and by whom?</li>
    <li>What was the process used to create the data product?</li>
    <li>Were two data products derived from the same raw data?</li>
</ul>

<p>Provenance management is a very time consuming and error-prone. But they are highly important to preserve data, determine
    data quality and authorship. Provenance has significant importance in scientific processes where reproducibility is important
    to validate the result data products and prove the results of scientific experiments. [3]
    There are different kinds of provenance. There is information on the dependency relationships among data products and the processes
    that generate them. Then there is also user defined information like decisions and notes that cannot be captured automatically.
    Workflow systems can be easily instrumented to automatically capture provenance. Not only capturing provenance but it is also
    important to model, store and query provenance. [3]</p>

<h5>Applications of provenance</h5>

<p>Provenance and scientific publications: A key benefit for maintaining provenance of computational results is reproducibility: a detailed record of the steps followed to produce a result allows others to reproduce and validate these results.
    Provenance and data exploration: Provenance can also be used to simplify exploratory processes. In particular, we present mechanisms that allow the flexible reuse of workflows; scalable exploration of large parameter spaces; and comparison of data products as well as their corresponding workflow.
    Social analysis of scientific data: Social Web sites and Web-based communities enable users to leverage the wisdom of the crowds. In the recent past, a new class of Web site has emerged that enables users to upload and collectively analyze many types of data.
    Provenance in education: Teaching is one of the killer applications of provenance-enabled workflow systems, in particular, for courses which have a strong data exploration component such as data mining and visualization. Provenance can help instructors to be more effective and improve the students' learning experience.</p>

<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>Information management infrastructure: With the growing volume of raw data, workflows and provenance information, there is a need for efficient and effective techniques to man- age these data.
    Provenance analytics and visualization: The problem of mining and extracting knowledge from provenance data has been largely unexplored.
    Interoperability: Complex data products may result from long processing chains that require multiples tools (e.g., scientific workflows and visualization tools). In order to provide detailed provenance for such data products, it becomes necessary to integrate provenance derived from different systems and represented using different models.</p>
