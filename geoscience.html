<h4>What is geosciene?</h4>

<p>Geo science is a science which focusing on studying earth. There are both reductionist and holistic approaches to Earth sciences.
Atmosphere, hydrosphere, oceans and biosphere, as well as the
solid earth are the main categories which include in exploring earth sciences. Earth scientists tend to use tools from physics,
chemistry, biology, chronology and mathematics to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth system works, and how it
evolved to its current state.</p>


<h4>Geoscience experiments</h4>
<p>
Earth systems are not standalone instances. They work together and have  relationships  within the earth systems .
    Therefore It is necessary  to discover and share geospatial data and processing resources across disciplines
    which enables    geo scientists to perform numerous amount of experiments in geosciences. Geoscience experiments
    take more time to produce results and they use large amount of data sets. Proper management and a maintenance is a
    major requirement of geoscience experiments. Predicting earthquakes,Tonados,Cyclone and etc are some areas which
    scientist use geo science data to perform experimnts.Apart from that Snow fall of world and how it affects to a
    country  with their patterns also can investigate by using data sets provides by various geo science data sources.
    There are number of ongoing geo science experiments which help to secure thousands of human life by providing
    indications of various natural disasters. Geoscience is a pretty interesting area to learn the behavior of the earth.

<h4>Geo Science Standards</h4>

<p>
Recently Geoscience standards play an important role in exchanging geo science data by providing standard interface to
    access geo spatial data. The reason for making geo science standards is because the  professionals seeking to
    understand and sustainably manage water, waste, energy, pollution, forests, croplands, oceans and climate find
    that data and processing "stovepipes" of various kinds often make such discovery and access difficult, even within
    a discipline. OGC is one of large organization which is formulate by a hundreds of organizations in geo field.
    OGC provides well define standards to build common interface for access geoscience data.

<h4>Geo Sceince data & Data sources</h4>
<p>
Geoscience data is provides a major role in the field of geo science experiments. There are organizations who manage
    and store numerous amount of data related to earth systems from early years of early years. These data stored
    in NoSQL databases like couchDB and mondoDb which contains thousands tera bytes of data. These data is very
    helpgul for performing geoscience experiments. There are geo science data sources which provide the access to
    geosceince data stored in databases as services. Scientists who are doing geo sceince experiments tend to use data
    from that sources to perform various experements.

<h4>
Geo Science data formats
</h4>

<p>Geo science data formats are the encoding formats of geo data. These format are well defined formats which describe
    how data arrange within a response. Users of the geo science data can decode the data according to underline Geo
    science data format. GeoJson is one of popular data format which created using JSON.  </p>
